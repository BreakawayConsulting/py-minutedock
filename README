# Python interface to MinuteDock

Included is a module `md.py` and a couple of example scripts for interacting with MinuteDock via their API.

This is implemented against the API docs: https://minutedock.com/apidocs

Given the current API is beta, this software should at best be considered alpha.
Most of the interfaces are read-only, but be careful about using `update` as this modifies your data, and may mess it up when used incorrectly.

Have fun!
